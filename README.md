Milestone Report 


Unfortunately I was not able to publish the Rmarkdown file to RPubs.  I'm hoping this plan B will suffice for the peer review.  

Thank you for your understanding!

Included files:  
1. The Rmarkdown file with the R code chunks 
2. The wordcloud generated prior to explore data prior to creating the document term matrix  
3. The single words with highest frequency, both with and without stop words
4. The top 10 2-gram frequency plot 
5. The top 10 3-gram frequency plot
